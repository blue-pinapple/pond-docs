# World Trimming

Think carefully about weather trimming is wanted or needed. Trimming is useful to allow new terrain to generate in unpopular areas and to save a little bit of storage. Keep in mind, you'll likely have to to pre-generate terrain again afterwards.

{% hint style="danger" %}
make sure to backup before proceding
{% endhint %}

On the apex website head to the `trim world` tab (you must be administrator to use this). Then input the world name (default is often right) and the amount of inhabited time ticks you want to trim.

{% hint style="warning" %}
you can not trim nether or end by itself
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The inhabited time of a chunk increases for each tick a player spends with the chunk loaded. This is a cumulative measure of timeâ€”if 50 players spend a single hour in a chunk, it counts the same as if one player spent 50 hours there
{% endhint %}

The equation for minuets to ticks is `<minutes> * 60 * 20`. Between 5-10 minutes is usually a good amount of time
